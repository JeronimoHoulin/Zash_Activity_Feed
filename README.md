#File Structure

The Src folder contains your typical App.js file and Components folder for a neat React structure.

In the components folder, there is a Header and a Dashboard folder, where the react components for each one resides. As well as a Content folder for images.

Basic CSS files affect each component individually, whilst the app.css will have basic CSS for the entire app.
